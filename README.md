# IP Country Flag

Master brach status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3D-I/IP-Country-Flags.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/3D-I/IP-Country-Flags)

IP Country Flag is an extension that requires at least phpBB version 3.1.9, works also on 3.2.x.
This is a port of the MOD I made first for phpBB2 and Categories Hiearchy MOD, then for phpBB3 (Olympus).

That would be a sort of Country Flags Invasion..
